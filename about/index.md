## Who Am I
I am a mechanical engineer working on finishing my undergraduate degree at the University of North Dakota. I currently work for Booz Allen Hamilton supporting the Air Force. I would like to pursue a M.S. in computer science and further my knowledge of programming, machine learning, and vision systems. I am interested in defense, space systems, aerospace, robotics, machine learning, project management, and continuing professional development to become a leader within the company I work for.

Beyond school and work I am a husband to an amazing wife. We live in Albuquerque, NM and look forward to the possibilities of moving out of the state we have called home for so long. We have a Siberian Husky who fills in as our only child (fur baby) at this time. I enjoy gaining skills in 3D-printing and rapid prototyping as a hobby. When I am not trying to further my programming skills, completing homework, or going to work you can find me watching movies or reading about the latest technology. If you would like to know more about me or the projects on my site please do not hesitate to ask.
